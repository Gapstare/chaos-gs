All network related servers are to be put here (both protocol implementations and hardware drivers).

Please do note that most of the hardware drivers are to be treated as [GPLv2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html) licensed. When we wrote this code around the year 2000, we were using [GNU/Linux](http://www.debian.org) and chaos was also GPL-licensed at that time. Hence, letting our code be heavily GPL-based was not a problem per se.

These days, things are obviously different and we are slowly but steadily moving towards a 3-clause BSD license instead. If you feel like rewriting some of these servers using e.g. hardware documentation instead, or even basing them on the FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD source code or something, by all means, *hack away*.

The following servers are written from scratch, and are already BSD licensed:

* ipv4
* loopback
