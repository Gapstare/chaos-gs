This is the keyboard server for use in a chaos system. Without it you
will not be able to take input via your keyboard. When it starts it
registers the port range 0x60-0x6F and IRQ 1. If one of these
operations fails, the keyboard server aborts startup. If a problem
like this occurs, it probably is because of another server already
having registered the ports or the IRQ.

If the startup was successful, the server then registers to the kernel
a service of protocol "keyboard" (IPC_PROTOCOL_KEYBOARD). The kernel
appends a number after this name, depending on how many other keyboard
services registered. This way, your USB-keyboard and your standard
keyboard servers both have to register a service of protocol
"keyboard", but the first one will be /services/keyboard/0 and the
second one will be /services/keyboard/1.

Because a lot of this code is based on the GPL:ed Linux kernel (which
you can see very quickly by browsing through e.g. keyboard.c), the server
can only be legally used under the terms of the GPL. Our own parts are of
course more liberally usable than so, but because of the intermingling here
it is probably safest to just assume the whole server is GPL:ed. If you want
to rewrite it all in pure, BSD-based goodness, please be our guest - pull
requests are certainly welcome here.
